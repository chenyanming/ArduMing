## SBP Bindings for C

libsbp provides C bindings for Swift Binary Protocol (SBP), the native
binary protocol used by the
[Piksi GPS receiver](http://swiftnav.com/piksi.html). It is intended
to be as portable as possible and is written in standards compliant C
with no dependencies other than the standard C libraries.

## Installation

On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu 12.10 or later) you can get
them with:

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config cmake
```

On other systems, you can obtain CMake from your operating system
package manager or from http://www.cmake.org/.

Once you have the dependencies installed, From the libsbp root
directory, create a build directory where the library will be built:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
```

Then invoke CMake to configure the build, and then build and install,

```shell
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
```

By default libsbp will be built both as a shared library `libsbp` and
a static library `libsbp-static`.

## Usage

For now, documentation for libsbp is available with
[libswiftnav](http://docs.swift-nav.com/libswiftnav/group__sbp.html). A
separate tutorial for applying SBP is at
https://github.com/swift-nav/sbp_tutorial.
